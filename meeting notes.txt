- send list of subs that are being dropped
- add time windows to Seth's code
- get rules/month
- get histogram of scrape window for each sub in both mako's data and seth's data

4/20/2023
COMPLETED:
     - hypothesis tests
     - punctuated equilibrium verification and clarification 
     - verify description deletions and violation deletions are correct
     - rerun pipeline


TO DO:
     - info on what % of subs that had less than four rules
     - what % of subs added a rule and deleted one

TO DO 
	- linear regression for box plots (rule level and sub level model) X
		- logistic regression if the outcome is dichotomous  X
		- linear regression if outcome is continuous X
			- if skewed, maybe binarize data

     - add rule age and rules added X
     - convert each scatter plot to boxplots  X
     - and add regression lines to scatterplots, plot these as two panels  X
     LONG TERM GOAL: results section and methods section
          - look at Seth's paper for methods section
          - make and share overleaf doc
          - take first stab at writing results (don't be conservative)

MODEL:
	- change age in months to age in years X
	- remove subscribers X
	- change model to robust X
	- change p threshold to 0.01 X
WRITEUP:
	- transfer writeup to mako's writeup X
	- add competing hypotheses to RQs X
	- include MLL test in analysis of parameters X
	- logit model for rule age and rule status X
